# Age Checker (Python)

My first Python program.

This program asks the user for their name and birth year,
then calculates their age and tells whether they are a minor or an adult.

## Features
- User input
- Age calculation
- Basic conditional logic

## How to run
Run the file in Python:

python main.py
